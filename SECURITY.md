## Reporting Security Issues

_Note: Please do not report security vulnerabilities
through public GitHub issues._

Instead, please report them through Akamai's [bug
bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/akamai?type=team) or
reach out to
[security@akamai.com](mailto:security@akamai.com).

If you wish to encrypt your communications, please use
the [Akamai Security PGP
key](https://www.akamai.com/content/dam/site/en/documents/akamai/2023/akamai-security-general.pub).

Please include the following information in your
report:

- the type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, ...)
- full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- the location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

We will work with you on resolving the issue and may
then create a public GitHub issue to track the update
and ensure transparency after we have resolved the
vulnerability.

## Policy

The Akamai [Security Research
Agreement](https://www.akamai.com/content/dam/site/en/documents/akamai/2024/security-research-agreement.pdf)
(SRA) provides the general framework for how you are
permitted to engage in any effort arising from or
related to the security of the Akamai ecosystem. By
participating in any of Akamaiâ€™s programs, you agree
to be subject to the SRA.
